<h1>THE LION</h1>
    <div class="dots">
        
<p>
    The lion (Panthera leo) is a large carnivorous feline and one of the most iconic animals in the world. Known as the "king of the jungle," lions are renowned for their majestic appearance and social structure. They typically inhabit grasslands, savannas, and open woodlands across sub-Saharan Africa, with a small population in the Gir Forest of India.

Male lions are easily recognizable by their thick manes, which vary in color and size, while females lack manes and are slightly smaller. Lions are social animals, living in groups called prides, which usually consist of related females, their offspring, and a few adult males. They are apex predators, preying on animals such as zebras, antelopes, and wildebeests.
